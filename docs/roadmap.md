# Roadmap 2016/12/27

## Step 1
* Play around with Vulkan
* Render a triangle, a box, a model, etc.
* Load models using Assimp

I believe that before the higher level design of the Entity-Component-System can be implemented a simple Vulkan renderer needs to
be working. 

## Step 2
* Build the basic architecture of the Entity-Component-System
* Implement RenderSystem using the Vulkan renderer
* Write a CMakeLists.txt

## Step 3
* ???
